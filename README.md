# Amandine translations

Welcome to the github repository for the translations strings of <a href="https://discord.io/amandine">Amandine</a>

## How can i help you to translate ?

- You need to have a GitHub account.
- You need to know how to fork the repo. If you don't follow <a href="https://blog.scottlowe.org/2015/01/27/using-fork-branch-git-workflow/">this</a> link.

After all that you have to make a pull request with your changes. Follow <a href="https://opensource.com/article/19/7/create-pull-request-github">this</a> link to know how to make a pull request.

Make sure you don't change any variable like ``${error}``, ``${permission}``

Don't change the ``$`` in the usage and examples.

At the end of the file there are two function that need to be translated to, make sure you don't forget them. ``printDate()``, ``convertMs()``

Make sure to put your discord tag in the comment of the pull request to get a ``Translator`` role if you are on the discord server. And maybe you would get some perks at the release date of this update.
